Temperature sensors:

-There are four main temperature sensors used today in modern-day electronics: 
-Negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistors, 
-resistance temperature detectors (RTDs), 
-thermocouples, 
-and semiconductor-based integrated (IC) sensors.

Pressure sensors:

Currently widely used pressure sensors include: 
-diffused silicon piezoresistive pressure sensors, 
-ceramic piezoresistive pressure sensors, 
-sputtered film pressure sensors, 
-capacitive pressure sensors, 
-and sapphire pressure sensors with high temperature resistance.
